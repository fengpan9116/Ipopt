\page INSTALL Installing Ipopt

\tableofcontents

The following sections describe the installation procedures on
UNIX/Linux systems. For installation instructions on Windows see
\ref INSTALL_WINDOWS.

Additional hints on installing \Ipopt and its various
interfaces is available on the \Ipopt and CoinHelp wiki
pages, in particular

- \Ipopt compilation hints:

\section SYSTEMPACKAGES Getting System Packages (Compilers, ...)

Many Linux distributions will come with all necessary tools. All you
should need to do is check the compiler versions. On a Debian-based
distribution, you can obtain all necessary tools with the following
command:

      sudo apt-get install gcc g++ gfortran git patch wget

Replace apt-get with your relevant package manager, e.g. yum for Red
Hat-based distributions, zypper for SUSE, etc. The g++ and gfortran
compilers may need to be specified respectively as gcc-c++ and
gcc-gfortran with some package managers.

On Mac OS X, you need either the [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads)
or a community alternative such as
<https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer> to install
the gcc and g++ compilers. It has been reported, that gcc/g++ 4.2 and
older is not sufficient for using the HSL codes. If you have a recent
version of Xcode installed, the Command Line Tools are available under
Preferences, Downloads. In Xcode 3.x, the Command Line Tools are
contained in the optional item "UNIX Dev Support" during Xcode
installation. These items unfortunately do not come with a Fortran
compiler, but you can get gfortran from
http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS. We have been able to
compile \Ipopt using default Xcode versions of gcc and g++
and a newer version of gfortran from this link, but consistent version
numbers may be an issue in future cases.

\section GETIPOPT Getting the Ipopt Code

\Ipopt is available from the COIN-OR group at GitHub. You can either
download the code using `git` or
simply retrieve a tarball (compressed archive file). While the tarball
is an easy method to retrieve the code, using the *git*
system allows users the benefits of the version control system,
including easy updates and revision control.

\section GETIPOPT_GIT Getting the Ipopt code via git

Of course, the *git* client must be installed on your system if you want
to obtain the code this way (the executable is called `git`).
Information about *git* and how to download it can be found at
<http://git-scm.com>.

To obtain the \Ipopt source code via git, change into the
directory in which you want to create a subdirectory CoinIpopt with the
\Ipopt source code. Then follow the steps below:

1.  Download the code from the repository:
    \verbatim
git clone --recursive -b stable/3.12 https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt.git CoinIpopt
    \endverbatim

2.  Change into the root directory of the \Ipopt distribution: \verbatim
cd CoinIpopt
    \endverbatim

In the following, `$IPOPTDIR` will refer to the directory in which you
are right now (output of `pwd`).

\section GETIPOPT_TAR Getting the Ipopt code as a tarball

To use the tarball, follow the steps below:

1.  Download the desired tarball from
    <http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt>, it has the form
    `Ipopt-x.y.z.tgz`, where `x.y.z` is the version number, such as
    3.12.0.

2.  Issue the following commands to unpack the archive file:
    \verbatim
gunzip Ipopt-x.y.z.tgz
tar xvf Ipopt-x.y.z.tar
    \endverbatim

3.  Rename the directory you just extracted: \verbatim
mv Ipopt-x.y.z CoinIpopt
    \endverbatim

4.  Change into the root directory of the \Ipopt distribution: \verbatim
cd CoinIpopt
    \endverbatim

In the following, `$IPOPTDIR` will refer to the directory in which you
are right now (output of `pwd`).

\section EXTERNALCODE Download External Code

\Ipopt uses a few external packages that are not included
in the \Ipopt source code distribution, namely ASL (the
AMPL Solver Library if you want to compile the \Ipopt AMPL
solver executable), Blas, Lapack.

\Ipopt also requires at least one linear solver for sparse
symmetric indefinite matrices. There are different possibilities, see
below. **It is important to keep in mind that usually
the largest fraction of computation time in the optimizer is spent for
solving the linear system, and that your choice of the linear solver
impacts \Ipopt's speed and robustness. It might be
worthwhile to try different linear solver to experiment with what is
best for your application.**

Since this third party software is released under different licenses
than \Ipopt, we cannot distribute their code together with
the \Ipopt packages and have to ask you to go through the
hassle of obtaining it yourself (even though we tried to make it as easy
for you as we could). Keep in mind that it is still your responsibility
to ensure that your downloading and usage of the third party components
conforms with their licenses.

Note that you only need to obtain the ASL if you intend to use
\Ipopt from AMPL. It is not required if you want to specify
your optimization problem in a programming language (C++, C, or
Fortran). Also, currently, Lapack is only required if you intend to use
the quasi-Newton options implemented in \Ipopt.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_LINALGASL Download BLAS, LAPACK and ASL

Note: It is **highly recommended that you obtain an efficient
implementation of the BLAS library**, tailored to your hardware;
Section \ref PREREQUISITES lists a few options. Assuming that your
precompiled efficient BLAS library is `libmyblas.a` in `$HOME/lib`, you
need to add the flag `--with-blas="-L$HOME/lib -lmyblas"` when you run
`configure` (see \ref COMPILEINSTALL). Some of those libraries also include
LAPACK.

If you have the download utility `wget` installed on your system (or
`ftp` on Mac OS X, or `curl`), retrieving source code for BLAS (the inefficient
reference implementation, not required if you have a precompiled
library), as well as LAPACK and ASL is straightforward using scripts
included with the ipopt distribution. These scripts download the
required files from the [Netlib Repository](http://www.netlib.org).

\verbatim
cd $IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/Blas
./get.Blas
cd $IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/Lapack
./get.Lapack
cd $IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/ASL
./get.ASL
\endverbatim

If you do not have `wget` (or `ftp` on Mac OS X or `curl`) installed on your
system, please read the `INSTALL.*` files in the
`$IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/Blas`, `$IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/Lapack` and
`$IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/ASL` directories for alternative instructions.

If you are having firewall issues with `wget`, try opening the
`get.<library>` scripts and replace the line `wgetcmd=wget` with
`wgetcmd="wget --passive-ftp"`.

If you are getting permissions errors from `tar`, try opening the
`get.<library>` scripts and replace any instances of `tar xf` with
`tar --no-same-owner -xf`.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_HSL Download HSL Subroutines

There are two versions of HSL available:

- HSL Archive:   contains outdated codes that are freely available for personal
    commercial or non-commercial usage. Note that you may not
    redistribute these codes in either source or binary form without
    purchasing a licence from the authors. This version includes MA27,
    MA28, and MC19.

- HSL 2011:   contains more modern codes that are freely available for academic
    use only. This version includes the codes from the HSL Archive and
    additionally MA57, HSL_MA77, HSL_MA86, and HSL_MA97.
    \Ipopt supports the HSL 2011 codes from 2012 and 2013,
    the support for the versions from 2012 may be dropped in a future
    release.

To obtain the HSL code, you can follow the following steps:

1.  Go to <http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt>.

2.  Choose whether to download either the Archive code or the HSL 2011
    code. To download, select the relevant "source" link.

3.  Follow the instructions on the website, read the license, and submit
    the registration form.

4.  Wait for an email containing a download link (this should take no
    more than one working day).

You may either:

-   Compile the HSL code as part of \Ipopt. See the
    instructions below.

-   Compile the HSL code separately either before or after the
    \Ipopt code and use the shared library loading
    mechanism. See the documentation distributed with the HSL package
    for information on how to do so.

To compile the HSL code as part of \Ipopt, unpack the
archive, then move and rename the resulting directory so that it becomes
`$IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/HSL/coinhsl`. \Ipopt may then be
configured as normal.

Note: Whereas it is essential to have at least one linear solver, the
package MC19 could be omitted (with the consequence that you cannot use
this method for scaling the linear systems arising inside the
\Ipopt algorithm). By default, MC19 is only used to scale
the linear system when using one of the HSL solvers, but it can also be
switched on for other linear solvers (which usually have internal
scaling mechanisms). Further, also the package MA28 can be omitted,
since it is used only in the experimental dependency detector, which is
not used by default.

Note: If you are an academic or a student, we recommend you download the
HSL 2011 package as this ensures you have access to the full range of
solvers. MA57 can be considerably faster than MA27 on some problems.

Yet another note: If you have a precompiled library containing the HSL
codes, you can specify the directory with the header files and the
linker flags for this library with the `--with-hsl-incdir` and
`--with-hsl-lib` flags for the configure script described in
\ref COMPILEINSTALL.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_MUMPS Obtaining the MUMPS Linear Solver

You can also use the (public domain) sparse linear solver MUMPS. Please
visit the [MUMPS home page](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS) for more
information about the solver. MUMPS is provided as Fortran 90 and C
source code. You need to have a Fortran 90 compiler (for example, the
GNU compiler gfortran is a free one) to be able to use it.

You can obtain the MUMPS code by running the script
`$IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/Mumps/get.Mumps` if you have `wget` (or `ftp` on Mac OS
X or `curl`) installed in your system. Alternatively, you can get
MUMPS 4.10 from the MUMPS home page and extract the archive in the
directory `$IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/Mumps`. The extracted directory usually
has the MUMPS version number in it, so you need to rename it to MUMPS
such that you have a file called
`$IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/Mumps/MUMPS/README`.

Once you put the MUMPS source code into the correct place, the
\Ipopt configuration scripts will automatically detect it
and compile MUMPS together with \Ipopt, *if your Fortran
compiler is able to compile Fortran 90 code*.

Note: MUMPS will perform better with METIS, see \ref DOWNLOAD_METIS.

Note: MUMPS uses interally a fake implementation of MPI. If you are
using \Ipopt within an MPI program together with MUMPS, the
code will not run. You will have to modify the MUMPS sources so that the
MPI symbols inside the MUMPS code are renamed.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_PARDISO Obtaining the Linear Solver Pardiso

If you would like to compile \Ipopt with the Parallel
Sparse Direct Linear Solver (Pardiso), you need to obtain either Intel's
MKL library or the Pardiso library from <http://www.pardiso-project.org>
for your operating system.

From <http://www.pardiso-project.org>, you can obtain a limited time
license of Pardiso for academic or evaluation purposes or buy a
non-profit or commercial license. Make sure you read the license
agreement before filling out the download form.

Please consult \ref EXPERT_INSTALL to find out how to configure your
\Ipopt installation to work with Pardiso.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_WSMP Obtaining the Linear Solver WSMP

If you would like to compile \Ipopt with the Watson Sparse
Matrix Package (WSMP), you need to obtain the WSMP library for your
operating system. Information about WSMP can be found at
<http://www.research.ibm.com/projects/wsmp>.

At this website you can download the library for several operating
systems including a trial license key for 90 days that allows you to use
WSMP for "educational, research, and benchmarking purposes by non-profit
academic institutions" or evaluation purposes by commercial
organizations; make sure you read the license agreement before using the
library. Once you obtained the library and license, please check if the
version number of the library matches the one on the WSMP website.

If a newer version is announced on that website, you can (and probably
should) request the current version by sending a message to
`wsmp@watson.ibm.com`. Please include the operating system and other
details to describe which particular version of WSMP you need.

Note: Only the interface to the shared-memory version of WSMP is
currently supported.

Please consult \ref EXPERT_INSTALL to find out how to configure your
\Ipopt installation to work with WSMP.

\subsection LINEARSOLVERLOADER Using the Linear Solver Loader

By default, \Ipopt will be compiled with a mechanism, the
Linear Solver Loader, which can dynamically load shared libraries with
MA27, MA57, HSL_MA77, HSL_MA86, HSL_MA97, or the Pardiso linear
solver at runtime.

This means, if you obtain one of those solvers
after you compiled \Ipopt, you don't need to recompile to
use it. Instead, you can just put a shared library called `libhsl.so` or
`libpardiso.so` into the shared library search path, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
These are the names on most UNIX platforms, including Linux. On Mac OS X,
the names are `libhsl.dylib`, `libpardiso.dylib`, and
`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. On Windows, the names are `libhsl.dll`,
`libpardiso.dll`, and `PATH`.

The Pardiso shared library can be downloaded from the Pardiso website.
To create a shared library containing the HSL linear solvers, read the
instructions in `$IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/HSL/INSTALL.HSL`.

The Linear Solver Loader is not enabled if you compile \Ipopt with the MS
Visual Studio project files provided in the \Ipopt distribution.
Further, if you have problems compiling this feature, you can disable this
by specifying `--disable-linear-solver-loader` for the `configure` script.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_METIS Obtaining METIS

The linear solvers MA57, HSL_MA77, HSL_MA86, HSL_MA97, and MUMPS can
make use of the matrix ordering algorithms implemented in
[METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview).
If you are using one of these linear solvers, you should obtain the METIS source
code and put it into `$IPOPTDIR/ThirdParty/Metis`. Read the
`INSTALL.Metis` file in that directory, and if you have the `wget`
utility (or `ftp` on Mac OS X or `curl`) installed on your system, you can
download the code by running the `./get.Metis` script.

Note, that **only the older [METIS 4.x version](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/sw/metis/OLD/metis-4.0.3.tar.gz) is supported** by
MA57, HSL_MA77, HSL_MA86, HSL_MA97, MUMPS, and the build system. The
`./get.Metis` script takes care of downloading the right METIS version.

\section COMPILEINSTALL Compiling and Installing Ipopt

\Ipopt can be easily compiled and installed with the usual
configure, make, make install commands. We follow the procedure that is
used for most of the COIN-OR projects, based on the GNU autotools. At
<https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp> you can find a general
description of the tools.

Below are the basic steps for the \Ipopt compilation that
should work on most systems. For special compilations and for some
troubleshooting see \ref EXPERT_INSTALL and consult the
[generic COIN-OR help page](https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp) before
creating an issue or sending a message to the mailing list.

1.  Create a directory where you want to compile \Ipopt, for example
    \verbatim
mkdir $IPOPTDIR/build
    \endverbatim
    and change into this directory
    \verbatim    
cd $IPOPTDIR/build
    \endverbatim

    Note: You can choose any location, including $IPOPTDIR itself, as
    the location of your compilation. However, on COIN-OR we recommend
    to keep the source and compiled files separate.

2.  Run the configure script:
    \verbatim
$IPOPTDIR/configure
    \endverbatim

    One might have to give options to the configure script, e.g., in
    order to choose a non-default compiler, or to tell it where some
    third party code is installed, see \ref EXPERT_INSTALL.

    If the last output line reads
    `configure: Main configuration of Ipopt successful` then
    everything worked fine. Otherwise, look at the screen output, have a
    look at the `config.log` output files and/or consult \ref EXPERT_INSTALL.

    The default configure (without any options) is sufficient for most
    users that downloaded the source code for the linear solver. If you
    want to see the configure options, consult \ref EXPERT_INSTALL and
    also visit the generic
    [COIN-OR configuration instruction page](https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp/wiki/user-configure).

3.  Build the code:
    \verbatim
make
    \endverbatim

    Note: If you are using GNU make, you can also try to speed up the
    compilation by using the `-jN` flag (e.g., `make -j3`), where `N` is the
    number of parallel compilation jobs. A good number for `N` is the
    number of available processors plus one. Under some circumstances,
    this fails, and you might have to re-issue the command, or omit the
    `-j` flag.

4.  If you want, you can run a short test to verify that the compilation
    was successful. For this, you just enter
    \verbatim
make test
    \endverbatim
    This will test if the AMPL solver executable works (if you got the
    ASL code) and if the included C++, C, and Fortran examples work.

    Note: The configure script is not able to automatically determine
    the C++ runtime libraries for the C++ compiler. For certain
    compilers we enabled default values for this, but those might not
    exist or be wrong for your compiler. In that case, the C and Fortran
    example in the test will most probably fail to compile. If you don't
    want to hook up the compiled \Ipopt library to some
    Fortran or C code that you wrote you don't need to worry about this.
    If you do want to link the \Ipopt library with a C or
    Fortran compiler, you need to find out the C++ runtime libraries
    (e.g., by running the C++ compiler in verbose mode for a simple
    example program) and run `configure` again, and this time specify all
    C++ runtime libraries with the `CXXLIBS` variable (see also
    \ref EXPERT_INSTALL).

5.  Install \Ipopt:
    \verbatim
make install
    \endverbatim
    This installs

    -   the \Ipopt AMPL solver executable (if ASL source
        was downloaded) in `$IPOPTDIR/build/bin`,

    -   the \Ipopt library (`libipopt.so`, `libipopt.a` or
        similar) and all its dependencies (MUMPS, HSL, Metis libraries)
        in `$IPOPTDIR/build/lib`,

    -   text files `ipopt_addlibs_cpp.txt`, `ipopt_addlibs_c.txt`, and
        `ipopt_addlibs_f.txt` in
        `$IPOPTDIR/build/share/coin/doc/Ipopt`, each containing a line
        with linking flags that are required for linking code with the
        \Ipopt library for C++, C, and Fortran main
        programs, respectively. (This is only for convenience if you
        want to find out what additional flags are required, for
        example, to include the Fortran runtime libraries with a C++
        compiler.)

    -   the necessary header files in `$IPOPTDIR/build/include/coin`.

    You can change the default installation directory (here
    `$IPOPTDIR/build`) to something else (such as `/usr/local`) by using
    the `--prefix` switch for `configure`.

6.  (Optional) Install \Ipopt for use with CUTEr:
    If you have CUTEr already installed on your system and you want to
    use \Ipopt as a solver for problems modeled in SIF, type
    \verbatim
make cuter
    \endverbatim
    This assumes that you have the environment variable `MYCUTER` defined
    according to the CUTEr instructions. After this, you can use the
    script `sdipo` as the CUTEr script to solve a SIF model.

Note: The above procedures show how to compile the code in directories
separate from the source files. This comes in handy when you want to
compile the code with different compilers, compiler options, or
different operating system that share a common file system. To use this
feature, change into the directory where you want to compile the code,
and then type `$IPOPTDIR/configure` with all the options. For this, the
directories with the \Ipopt source must not have any
configuration and compiled code.

\section INSTALL_WINDOWS Installation on Windows

There are several ways to install \Ipopt on Windows
systems. The first two options, described in \ref INSTALL_CYGWIN and
\ref INSTALL_CYGWINNATIVE, are to use [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com),
which offers a comprehensive UNIX-like environment on Windows and in
which the installation procedure described
earlier in this section can be used. If you want to use the (free) GNU
compilers, follow the instructions in \ref INSTALL_CYGWIN.
If you have the Microsoft C++ compiler and possibly a "native" Fortran
compiler (e.g., the Intel Fortran compiler)
and want to use those to compile \Ipopt, please see
\ref INSTALL_CYGWINNATIVE. If you use MSYS/MinGW (a light-weight
UNIX-like environment for Windows), please consider the notes in
\ref INSTALL_MINGW. If you want to compile the
\Ipopt mex interface to MATLAB, then we recommend to use the MSYS/MinGW option.

Note: Some binaries for \Ipopt are available on the COIN-OR
website at <http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Ipopt>. There, also
precompiled versions of \Ipopt as DLLs (generated from the
MSVS solution in \Ipopt's subdirectory
`$IPOPTDIR/Ipopt/MSVisualStudio/v8-ifort`) are available. Look at the
`README` files for details. An example how to use these DLLs from your
own MSVS project is in
`$IPOPTDIR/Ipopt/MSVisualStudio/BinaryDLL-Link-Example`.

\subsection INSTALL_CYGWIN Installation with Cygwin using GNU compilers

Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows; if you don't know what
it is you might want to have a look at the [Cygwin homepage](http://www.cygwin.com).

It is possible to build the \Ipopt AMPL solver executable
in Cygwin for general use in Windows. You can also hook up
\Ipopt to your own program if you compile it in the Cygwin
environment. (It is also possible to build an \Ipopt DLL that can
be used from non-cygwin compilers, but this is not (yet?) supported.)

If you want to compile \Ipopt under Cygwin, you first have
to install Cygwin on your Windows system. This is pretty straight
forward; you simply download the "setup" program from
<http://www.cygwin.com> and start it.

Then you do the following steps (assuming here that you don't have any
complications with firewall settings etc - in that case you might have
to choose some connection settings differently):

1.  Click next

2.  Select "install from the internet" (default) and click next

3.  Select a directory where Cygwin is to be installed (you can leave
    the default) and choose all other things to your liking, then click
    next

4.  Select a temp dir for Cygwin setup to store some files (if you put
    it on your desktop you will later remember to delete it)

5.  Select "direct connection" (default) and click next

6.  Select some mirror site that seems close by to you and click next

7.  OK, now comes the complicated part:
    You need to select the packages that you want to have installed. By
    default, there are already selections, but the compilers are usually
    not pre-chosen. You need to make sure that you select the GNU
    compilers (for Fortran, C, and C++), Git, and some additional
    tools. For this, get the following packages from the associated
    branches:

    -   "Devel": gcc4

    -   "Devel": gcc4-fortran

    -   "Devel": pkg-config

    -   "Devel": subversion

    -   "Archive": unzip

    -   "Utils": patch

    -   "Web": wget

    When a Resolving Dependencies window comes up, be sure to "Select
    required packages (RECOMMENDED)". This will automatically also
    select some other packages.

8.  Then you click
    on next, and Cygwin will be installed (follow the rest of the
    instructions and choose everything else to your liking). At a later
    point you can easily add/remove packages with the setup program.

9.  The version of the GNU Make utility provided by the Cygwin installer
    will not work. Therefore, you need to download the fixed version
    from <http://www.cmake.org/files/cygwin/make.exe> and save it to
    `C:\cygwin\bin`. Double-check this new version
    by typing `make --version` in a Cygwin terminal (see next point). If
    you get an error `-bash: /usr/bin/make: Bad address`, then try
    <http://www.cmake.org/files/cygwin/make.exe-cygwin1.7> instead,
    rename it to make.exe and move it to `C:\cygwin\bin`.
    (Replace `C:\cygwin` with your installation location if different.)

10. Now that you have Cygwin, you can open a Cygwin window, which is
    like a UNIX shell window.

11. Now you just follow the instructions in the beginning of
    \ref INSTALL : You download the \Ipopt code
    into your Cygwin home directory (from the Windows explorer that is
    usually something like `C:\Cygwin\home\your_user_name`). After
    that you obtain the third party code (as on Linux/UNIX), type
    \verbatim
./configure
make install
    \endverbatim
    in the correct directories, and hopefully that will work. The
    \Ipopt AMPL solver executable will be in the
    subdirectory `bin` (called `ipopt.exe`). If you want to test the
    installation, type
    \verbatim
make test
    \endverbatim

\subsection INSTALL_CYGWINNATIVE Installation with Cygwin using the MSVC++ compiler

This section describes how you can compile \Ipopt with the
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler under Cygwin. Here you have two options
for compiling the Fortran code in the third party dependencies:

-   Using a Windows Fortran compiler, e.g., the Intel Fortran compiler,
    which is also able to compile Fortran 90 code. This would allow you
    to compile the MUMPS linear solver if you desire to do so.

-   Using the f2c Fortran to C compiler, available for free at Netlib
    (see <http://www.netlib.org/f2c>). This can only compile Fortran 77
    code (i.e., you won't be able to compile MUMPS). Before doing the
    following installation steps, you need to follow the instructions
    in `$IPOPTDIR/BuildTools/compile_f2c/INSTALL`.

Once you have settled on this, do the following:

1.  Follow the instructions in \ref INSTALL_CYGWIN until
    Step 11 and stop after your downloaded the third party code.

2.  Now you need to make sure that Cygwin knows about the native
    compilers. For this you need to edit the file `cygwin.bat` in the
    Cygwin base directory (usually `C:\cygwin`). Here you need
    to add a line like the following:
    \verbatim
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
    \endverbatim

    On my computer, this sets the environment variables so that I can
    use the MSVC++ compiler.

    If you want to use also a native Fortran compiler, you need to
    include something like this
    \verbatim
call "C:\Program Files\Intel\Fortran\compiler80\IA32\BIN\ifortvars.bat"
    \endverbatim

    You might have to search around a bit. The important thing is that,
    after your change, you can type `cl` in a newly opened Cygwin
    windows, and it finds the Microsoft C++ compiler (and if you want to
    use it, the Fortran compiler, such as the Intel's `ifort`).

3.  Run the configuration script, and tell it that you want to use the
    native compilers:
    \verbatim
./configure –enable-doscompile=msvc
    \endverbatim

    Make sure the last message is `Main Ipopt configuration successful`.

4.  Now you can compile the code with
    \verbatim
make
    \endverbatim
    test the installation with
    \verbatim
make test
    \endverbatim
    and install everything with
    \verbatim
make install
    \endverbatim

\subsection INSTALL_MINGW Installation with MSYS/MinGW

You can compile \Ipopt also under MSYS/MinGW, which is
another, more light-weight UNIX-like environment for Windows. It can be
obtained from <http://www.mingw.org/>.

If you want to use MSYS/MinGW to compile \Ipopt with native
Windows compilers (see \ref INSTALL_CYGWINNATIVE), all you need to install
is the basic version (a convenient Windows install program is available from
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/>).
If you also want to use the GNU compilers, you need to install those as
well, of course.

A compilation with the GNU compilers works just like with any other UNIX
system, as described in \ref COMPILEINSTALL. That is, during the installation, select
(at least) the C Compiler, C++ Compiler, Fortran Compiler, MSYS Basic
System, and the MinGW Developer ToolKit. Additionally, wget and unzip
should be installed with the following command in an MSYS terminal:
\verbatim
mingw-get install msys-wget msys-unzip
\endverbatim

If you want to use the native MSVC++ compiler (with `f2c` or a native
Fortran compiler), you essentially follow the steps outlined in
\ref INSTALL_CYGWINNATIVE. Additionally, you need to make sure
that the environment variables are set for the compilers (see
step 2), this time adding the line to the msys.bat file.

For a 64-bit build, you will need to install also a MinGW-64
distribution. We recommend TDM-GCC, which is available from
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/tdm-gcc-webdl.exe/download>.
Install MinGW-64 in a different folder than your existing 32-bit MinGW
installation! The components you need are: core (under gcc), c++ (under
gcc), fortran (under gcc), openmp (under gcc, necessary if you want to
use any multi-threaded linear solvers), binutils, and mingw64-runtime.

After MinGW-64 is installed, open the file `C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\fstab`,
and replace the line
\verbatim
C:\MinGW\     /mingw
\endverbatim
with
\verbatim
C:\MinGW64\   /mingw
\endverbatim

(Replace paths with your installation locations if different.)

\section INSTALL_JAVA Compiling and Installing the Java Interface JIpopt

*based on documentation by Rafael de Pelegrini Soares* (VRTech Industrial Technologies)

`JIpopt` uses the Java Native Interface (JNI), which is a
programming framework that allows Java code running in the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) to call and be called by native applications and libraries
written in languages such as C and C++. `JIpopt` requires Java 5 or higher.

After building and installing \Ipopt, the `JIpopt` interface can be build
by setting the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the directory that
contains your JDK, changing to the `JIpopt` directory in your \Ipopt build,
and issuing make, e.g.,
\verbatim
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0
cd $IPOPTDIR/build/Ipopt/contrib/JavaInterface
make
\endverbatim

This will generate the Java class org/coinor/Ipopt.class, which you will
need to make available in your Java code (i.e., add
`$IPOPTDIR/build/Ipopt/contrib/JavaInterface` to your `CLASSPATH`) and the
shared object `lib/libjipopt.so` (on Linux/UNIX) or `lib/libjipopt.dylib`
(on Mac OS X) or the DLL `lib/jipopt.dll` (on Windows). In order to test
your `JIpopt` library you can run two example problems by
issuing the command `make test` inside the `JIpopt` directory.

\note The `JIpopt` build procedure currently cannot deal
with spaces in the path to the JDK. If you are on Windows and have Java
in a path like `C:\Program Files\Java`, try setting `JAVA_HOME` to the
DOS equivalent `C:\Progra~1\Java` (or similar).

\note `JIpopt` needs to be able to load the
\Ipopt library dynamically at runtime. Therefore,
\Ipopt must have been compiled with the `-fPIC` compiler
flag. While per default, an Ipopt shared library is compiled with this
flag, for a configuration of \Ipopt in debug mode
(`--enable-debug`) or as static library (`--disable-shared`), the configure
flag `--with-pic` need to be used to enable compilation with `-fPIC`.

\section INSTALL_R Compiling and Installing the R Interface ipoptr

The `ipoptr` interface can be build after \Ipopt has been
build and installed. In the best case, it is sufficient to execute the
following command in R:
\verbatim
install.packages('$IPOPTDIR/build/Ipopt/contrib/RInterface', repos=NULL, type='source')
\endverbatim

In certain situations, however, it can be necessary to setup the dynamic
library load path to the path where the \Ipopt library has
been installed, e.g.,
\verbatim
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$IPOPTDIR/build/lib
\endverbatim

\note R needs to be able to load the \Ipopt library
dynamically at runtime. Therefore, \Ipopt must have been
compiled with the `-fPIC` compiler flag. While per default, an Ipopt
shared library is compiled with this flag, for a configuration of
\Ipopt in debug mode (`--enable-debug`) or as static library
(`--disable-shared`), the configure flag `--with-pic` need to be used to
enable compilation with `-fPIC`.

After installation of the `ipoptr` package, it should be possible to
load the package in R and to view the help page:
\verbatim
library('ipoptr')
?ipoptr
\endverbatim

\section INSTALL_MATLAB Compiling and Installing the MATLAB interface

*based on documentation by Peter Carbonetto (University of British Columbia),
Tony Kelman (then University of California, Berkeley), and Ray Zimmerman*

The MATLAB interface to \Ipopt uses the mex interface of MATLAB.
It has been tested on MATLAB versions 7.2 through 7.7. It might very well work
on earlier versions of MATLAB, but there is also a good chance that it
will not. It is unlikely that the software will run with
versions prior to MATLAB 6.5.

\note The MATLAB interface **does not support MATLAB 8.3** (aka, R2014a),
as it has not been adapted to MATLAB changes in the buildsystem for MEX files.

First, note that some binaries of \Ipopt mex files are
available for download at <http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Ipopt>.
Further, the [OPTI Toolbox](http://www.i2c2.aut.ac.nz/Wiki/OPTI)
comes with a precompiled MATLAB interface for \Ipopt on Windows.

\subsection INSTALL_MATLAB_MEX Setting up mex

To build the interface by yourself, you will need to have
MATLAB installed on your system and have it configured to
build mex files, see
<http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1605.html> for detail
on how to set this up.

\Ipopt 3.11 has added Makefile options to automate fixes for
commonly-encountered issues with building the MATLAB interface.
On Mac OS X or Windows, the file `mexopts.sh` (`mexopts.bat` on
Windows) will need to be modified. This is performed automatically by
calling `make mexopts` in the
`$IPOPTDIR/build/Ipopt/contrib/MatlabInterface/src` directory. No changes
will be made if you already have a `mexopts.sh` file in that directory. If
you need to make these modifications manually, follow the steps below.

For Mac OS X, the following procedure has been reported: First, one
executes a command like
\verbatim
/Applications/MATLAB_R2012.app/bin/mex -setup
\endverbatim

This creates a `mexopts.sh` file in the `~/.matlab/R2010` directory. Copy
that file to the directory
`$IPOPTDIR/build/Ipopt/contrib/MatlabInterface/src` and modify it as
follows.

-   In the `maci` section (32 bit builds) or the `maci64` section (64 bit
    builds), change both instances of `libgfortran.dylib` to `libgfortran.a`
    in the `FC_LIBDIR` line (in case your Fortran compiler only comes
    with static libraries).

-   Remove all occurrences of `-isysroot $SDKROOT` or
    `-Wl,-syslibroot,$SDKROOT` in case the hard-coded version of the
    Xcode SDK that Matlab expects does not match what you have installed
    on your system.

-   Remove all occurrences of `-arch $ARCHS` in case you are using a GNU
    compiler that does not recognize these Apple-specific flags.

On Windows, if you are using the GNU compilers via MinGW, then you will
need to use the gnumex project. First, execute the script `./get.Gnumex`
from the `$IPOPTDIR/Ipopt/contrib/MatlabInterface` directory. Then, after
configuring \Ipopt, go to
`$IPOPTDIR/build/contrib/MatlabInterface/src` and execute `make gnumex`.
This will start an instance of MATLAB and open the gnumex tool.
Check that the options are filled out appropriately for your MinGW
installation, click "Make options file," then close this new instance
of MATLAB after gnumex has created `mexopts.bat`.

Calling `make mexopts` will automatically make the necessary changes to
this new `mexopts.bat` file. If you would like to do so manually, the
changes are as follows.

-   Change `COMPILER=gcc` to `COMPILER=g++`

-   Change `GM_MEXLANG=c` to `GM_MEXLANG=cxx`

-   Add the contents of the `LIBS=` line from the MATLAB
    interface Makefile to `GM_ADD_LIBS`

-   If you want to statically link the standard libraries into the mex
    file, add `-static` to `GM_ADD_LIBS`

\subsection INSTALL_MATLAB_IPOPT Adjusting configuration and build of Ipopt

The configure script of \Ipopt attempts to automatically
locate the directory where MATLAB is installed by querying
the location of the matlab executable. You can also manually specify the
MATLAB home directory when calling the configure script
with the flag `--with-matlab-home`. You can determine this home directory
by the command `matlabroot` within MATLAB.

In practice, it has been found easier to install and use the
MATLAB interface by disabling compilation of the shared
libraries, and use only static libraries instead. However, these static
libraries need to be built in a way that allow using them in a shared
library, i.e., they need to build with position-independent code. This
is achieved with the configure script flags `--disable-shared --with-pic`.

On Mac OS X, it has been reported that additionally the following flags
for configure should be used:
\verbatim
ADD_CFLAGS="-fno-common -fexceptions -no-cpp-precomp"
ADD_CXXFLAGS="-fno-common -fexceptions -no-cpp-precomp"
ADD_FFLAGS="-fexceptions -fbackslash"
\endverbatim

With \Ipopt 3.11, a *site script for configure* has been
added to the MATLAB interface. This script takes care of
setting configure options in a way that is appropriate for building an
\Ipopt mex file that is useable via MATLAB.
Therefore, instead of setting configure options as described in the
previous section, it should be sufficient to create a directory
`$IPOPTDIR/build/share`, copy the site file
`$IPOPTDIR/contrib/MatlabInterface/MatlabInterface.site` to that
directory, and rename it to `config.site` before running configure.
Alternatively, you can set an environment variable `CONFIG_SITE` that
points to the site file.

This site script sets the configure flags (if not specified by the user)
`--disable-shared --with-pic --with-blas=BUILD --with-lapack=BUILD`. The
first two flags are discussed above. We also specify that the reference
versions of BLAS and LAPACK should be used by default because of a
commonly observed issue on 64-bit Linux systems. If \Ipopt
configure finds BLAS and/or LAPACK libraries already installed then it
will use them. However, MATLAB includes its own versions
of BLAS and LAPACK, which on 64-bit systems are incompatible with the
expected interface used by \Ipopt and the BLAS and LAPACK
packages available in many Linux distributions. If the
\Ipopt mex file is compiled in such a way that the BLAS and
LAPACK libraries are dynamically linked as shared libraries (as found in
installed Linux packages), those library dependencies will be overridden
by MATLAB's incompatible versions. This can be avoided by
statically linking BLAS and LAPACK into the \Ipopt mex
file, which the above combination of configure flags will do. Note, that
this issue does not appear to affect Mac OS X versions of
MATLAB, so if you would like to use the Apple optimized
BLAS and LAPACK libraries you can override these settings and specify
`--with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack='-framework vecLib'`.

The site script also tests whether the compilers on your system are
capable of statically linking the standard C++ and Fortran libraries
into a shared library. This is possible with GCC versions 4.5.0 or newer
on Mac OS X or Windows, 4.7.3 or newer (when GCC itself is built
`--with-pic`) on Linux. If this is the case, then the site script will set
appropriate configure flags and options in the MATLAB
interface Makefile to statically link all standard libraries into the
\Ipopt mex file. This should allow a single mex file to
work with a variety of versions of MATLAB, and on
computers that do not have the same compiler versions installed. If this
static linking of standard libraries causes any issues, you can disable
it with the configure flag --disable-matlab-static.

\subsection INSTALL_MATLAB_BUILD Building the MATLAB interface

After configuring, building, and installing \Ipopt itself,
it is time to build the MATLAB interface. For that,
\Ipopt's configure has setup a directory
`$IPOPTDIR/build/contrib/MatlabInterface/src` which contains a Makefile.
You may need to edit this file a little bit to suit for your system
setup. You will find that most of the variables such as `CXX` and `CXXFLAGS`
have been automatically (and hopefully, correctly) set according to the
flags specified during your initial call to configure script. However,
you may need to modify `MATLAB_HOME`, `MEXSUFFIX` and `MEX` as explained in
the comments of the Makefile. For example, on Mac OS X, it has been
reported that all duplicates of strings like
`-L/usr/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin11/4.2.1/../../..` should be removed from
the `LIBS` line.

Once you think you've set up the Makefile properly, type `make install` in
the same directory as the Makefile. If you didn't get any errors, then
you should have ended up with a mex file. The mex file will be called
`ipopt.$MEXEXT`, where `$MEXEXT` is `mexglx` for 32-bit Linux, `mexa64` for
64-bit Linux, `mexw32` for 32-bit Windows, etc.

\subsection INSTALL_MATLAB_ADDPATH Making MATLAB aware of the mex file

In order to use the mex file in MATLAB, you need to tell
MATLAB where to find it. The best way to do this is to type
\verbatim
addpath <sourcedir>
\endverbatim
in the MATLAB command prompt, where `<sourcedir>` is the
location of the mex file you created. (For more information, type `help
addpath` in MATLAB. You can also achieve the same thing by
modifying the `MATLABPATH` environment variable in the UNIX command line,
using either the `export` command (in Bash shell) or the `setenv` command
(in C-shell).

\subsection INSTALL_MATLAB_NOTES Additional notes

Starting with version 7.3, MATLAB can handle 64-bit
addressing, and the authors of MATLAB have modified the
implementation of sparse matrices to reflect this change. However, the
row and column indices in the sparse matrix are converted to signed
integers, and this could potentially cause problems when dealing with
large, sparse matrices on 64-bit platforms with MATLAB
version 7.3 or greater.

As MATLAB (version R2008a or newer) includes its own HSL
MA57 library, \Ipopt's configure can be setup to enable
using this library in \Ipopt's MA57 solver interface. To
enable this, one should specify the configure option
`--enable-matlab-ma57`. Note, that using this option is not advisable if
one also provides the source for MA57 via ThirdParty/HSL.

\subsection INSTALL_MATLAB_TROUBLESHOOT Troubleshooting

The installation procedure described above does involve a certain amount
of expertise on the part of the user. If you are encountering problems,
it is highly recommended that you follow the standard installation of
\Ipopt first, and then test the installation by running
some examples, either in C++ or in AMPL.

What follows are a list of common errors encountered, along with a
suggested remedy.

- __Problem:__ compilation is successful, but MATLAB crashes

  __Remedy:__ Even if you didn't get any errors during compilation,
there's still a possibility that you didn't link the mex file properly.
In this case, executing \Ipopt in MATLAB will
cause MATLAB to crash. This is a common problem, and
usually arises because you did not choose the proper compiler or set the
proper compilation flags (e.g. `--with-pic`) when you ran the configure
script at the very beginning.

- __Problem:__ MATLAB fails to link to \Ipopt shared library

  __Remedy:__ You might encounter this problem if you try to execute one
of the examples in MATLAB, and MATLAB
complains that it cannot find the \Ipopt shared library.
The installation script has been set up so that the mex file you are
calling knows where to look for the \Ipopt shared library.
However, if you moved the library then you will run into a problem. One
way to fix this problem is to modify the `LDFLAGS` variable in the
MATLAB interface Makefile (see above) so that the correct
path of the \Ipopt library is specified. Alternatively, you
could modify the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable so that the
location of the \Ipopt library is included in the path. If
none of this is familiar to you, you might want to do a web search to
find out more.

- __Problem:__ `mwIndex` is not defined

  __Remedy:__ You may get a compilation error that says something to the
effect that `mwIndex` is not defined. This error will surface on a version
of MATLAB prior to 7.3. The solution is to add the flag
`-DMWINDEXISINT` to the `CXXFLAGS` variable in the MATLAB
interface Makefile (see above).

\section EXPERT_INSTALL Expert Installation Options for Ipopt

The configuration script and Makefiles in the \Ipopt
distribution have been created using GNU's autoconf and automake. They
attempt to automatically adapt the compiler settings, etc., to the system
they are running on. We tested the provided scripts for a number of
different machines, operating systems and compilers, but you might run
into a situation where the default setting does not work, or where you
need to change the settings to fit your particular environment.

In general, you can see the list of options and variables that can be
set for the configure script by typing `configure --help`. Also, the
[generic COIN-OR help pages](https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp)
are a valuable resource of information.

Below a few particular options are discussed:

-   The configure script tries to determine automatically, if you have
    BLAS and/or LAPACK already installed on your system (trying a few
    default libraries), and if it does not find them, it makes sure that
    you put the source code in the required place.

    However, you can specify a BLAS library (such as your local
    [ATLAS library](http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net)) explicitly,
    using the `--with-blas` flag for configure. For example,
    \verbatim
./configure --with-blas="-L$HOME/lib -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas"
    \endverbatim

    To tell the configure script to compile and use the downloaded BLAS
    source files even if a BLAS library is found on your system, specify
    `--with-blas=BUILD`.

    Similarly, you can use the `--with-lapack` switch to specify the
    location of your LAPACK library, or use the keyword `BUILD` to force
    the \Ipopt makefiles to compile LAPACK together with \Ipopt.

-   Similarly, if you have a precompiled library containing the HSL
    packages, you can specify the directory with the `CoinHslConfig.h`
    header file with the `--with-hsl-incdir` flag and the linker flags
    with the `--with-hsl-lib` flag. Analogously, use `--with-asl-incdir`
    and `--with-asl-lib` for building against a precompiled AMPL solver
    library.

-   The HSL codes `HSL_MA86` and `HSL_MA97` can run in parallel if
    compiled with OpenMP support. By default, this is not enabled by
    \Ipopt's configure so far. To enable OpenMP with GNU
    compilers, it has been reported that the following configure flags
    should be used:
    \verbatim
ADD_CFLAGS=-fopenmp ADD_FFLAGS=-fopenmp ADD_CXXFLAGS=-fopenmp
    \endverbatim

-   If you want to compile \Ipopt with the linear solver
    Pardiso (see \ref DOWNLOAD_PARDISO) from the Pardiso project website, you need
    to specify the link flags for the library with the `--with-pardiso`
    flag, including required additional libraries and flags. For
    example, if you want to compile \Ipopt with the
    parallel version of Pardiso (located in `$HOME/lib`) on an AIX system
    in 64bit mode, you should add the flag
    \verbatim
--with-pardiso="-qsmp=omp $HOME/lib/libpardiso_P4AIX51_64_P.so"
    \endverbatim

    If you are using the parallel version of Pardiso, you need to
    specify the number of processors it should run on with the
    environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, as described in the Pardiso
    manual.

    If you want to compile \Ipopt with the Pardiso library
    that is included in Intel MKL, it should be sufficient to ensure
    that MKL is used for the linear algebra routines (Blas/Lapack). On
    some systems, configure is able to find MKL automatically when
    looking for Blas. On other systems, one has to specify the MKL
    libraries with the `--with-blas` option.

-   If you want to compile \Ipopt with the linear solver
    WSMP (see \ref DOWNLOAD_WSMP), you need to specify the link flags for
    the library with the `--with-wsmp` flag, including required additional
    libraries and flags. For example, if you want to compile
    \Ipopt with WSMP (located in `$HOME/lib`) on an Intel
    IA32 Linux system, you should add the flag
    \verbatim
--with-wsmp="$HOME/lib/wsmp/wsmp-Linux/lib/IA32/libwsmp.a -lpthread"
    \endverbatim

-   If you want to compile \Ipopt with a precompiled MUMPS
    library (see \ref DOWNLOAD_MUMPS), you need to specify the directory
    containing the MUMPS header files with the `--with-mumps-incdir`
    flag, e.g.,
    \verbatim
--with-mumps-incdir="$HOME/MUMPS/include"
    \endverbatim
    and you also need to provide the link flags for MUMPS with the
    `--with-mumps-lib` flag.

-   If you want to specify that you want to use particular compilers,
    you can do so by adding the variables definitions for CXX, CC, and
    F77 to the `./configure` command line, to specify the C++, C, and
    Fortran compiler, respectively. For example,
    \verbatim
./configure CXX=g++-4.2.0 CC=gcc-4.2.0 F77=gfortran-4.2.0
    \endverbatim

    In order to set the compiler flags, you should use the variables
    `CXXFLAGS`, `CFLAGS`, `FFLAGS`. Note, that the \Ipopt code
    uses `dynamic_cast`. Therefore it is necessary that the C++ code is
    compiled including RTTI (Run-Time Type Information). Some compilers
    need to be given special flags to do that (e.g., `-qrtti=dyna` for
    the AIX `xlC` compiler).

    Please also check the [generic COIN-OR help page](https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp/wiki/user-configure#GivingOptions)
    for the description of more variables that can be set for configure.

-   By default, the \Ipopt library is compiled as a shared
    library, on systems where this is supported. If you want to generate
    a static library, you need to specify the `--disable-shared` flag. If
    you want to compile both shared and static libraries, you should
    specify the `--enable-static` flag.

-   If you want to link the \Ipopt library with a main
    program written in C or Fortran, the C and Fortran compiler doing
    the linking of the executable needs to be told about the C++ runtime
    libraries. Unfortunately, the current version of autoconf does not
    provide the automatic detection of those libraries. We have
    hard-coded some default values for some systems and compilers, but
    this might not work all the time.

    If you have problems linking your Fortran or C code with the
    \Ipopt library libipopt.a and the linker complains
    about missing symbols from C++ (e.g., the standard template
    library), you should specify the C++ libraries with the `CXXLIBS`
    variable. To find out what those libraries are, it is probably
    helpful to link a simple C++ program with verbose compiler output.

    For example, for the Intel compilers on a Linux system, you might
    need to specify something like
    \verbatim
./configure CC=icc F77=ifort CXX=icpc CXXLIBS='-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2.3 -lstdc++'
    \endverbatim

-   Compilation in 64bit mode sometimes requires some special
    consideration. For example, for compilation of 64bit code on AIX, we
    recommend the following configuration
    \verbatim
./configure AR='ar -X64' NM='nm -X64' CC='xlc -q64' F77='xlf -q64' CXX='xlC -q64' CFLAGS='-O3 -bmaxdata:0x3f0000000' FFLAGS='-O3 -bmaxdata:0x3f0000000' CXXFLAGS='-qrtti=dyna -O3 -bmaxdata:0x3f0000000'
    \endverbatim
    (Alternatively, a simpler solution for AIX is to set the environment
    variable `OBJECT_MODE` to 64.)

-   It is possible to compile the \Ipopt library in a debug
    configuration, by specifying `--enable-debug`. Then the compilers
    will use the debug flags (unless the compilation flag variables are
    overwritten in the configure command line)

    Also, you can tell \Ipopt to do some additional runtime
    sanity checks, by specifying the flag `--with-ipopt-checklevel=1`.

    This usually leads to a significant slowdown of the code, but might
    be helpful when debugging something.
